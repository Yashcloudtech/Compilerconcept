#Compiler Project

This is a simple compiler project implemented in Python up to the parser stage. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the process of lexical analysis and parsing for a programming language.

## Project Overview
This compiler project is divided into different stages:
1. **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenization of the input source code.
2. **Parsing**: Building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based on the tokenized code.

#Here below is the working of the program how it will look and run: -
